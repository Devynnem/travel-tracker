# Travel Tracker

## Abstract
This web application was focused on creating a dashboard with easy to read information about the users history of traveling. It allows the user to see past trips, how much money they spent, and request new trips. This web application works with a local server and makes network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data. 

## Setup
Fork and clone this [repo](https://github.com/Devynnem/travel-tracker) and then in a different folder, fork and clone this [local server repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api).

Do the following steps for both repos. Both repos need to be running in order for the app to work correctly.

In your forked GitHub repository, click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key. 
Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to. On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier. A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory.

Install the library dependencies:

Run: ```npm install```
Next: ```npm start``` in the terminal to see the HTML page

```Control + C``` is the command to stop running the local server

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the Travel Tracker Page.

## Reflections: 
This project was a culmunation of everything that has been taught at Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program for the past 12 weeks. This is the final solo project of Module two, a four module, seven month focused program on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This project was completed over the course of six days in line with the project specification and rubric detailed in this [rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html). This project allowed myself to continue growing my cooperative learning skills, communication, and my software developer skills. 

## Technologies Used:
Javascript | Mocha & Chai | API | CSS | HTML

## Wins/Challenges:
Challenges: 
- One of the major challenges I faced was iterating through all of the data correctly.
- Also correctly figruing out how to POST the new information.

Wins: 
 - Working solo on a large project.
 - Effectively Fetching data from an API.
 - Effective use of iterators.
